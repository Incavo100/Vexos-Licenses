## ⚖️ License Overview

| Acronym | Full Name | Type | Source | Description |
|----------|------------|------|---------|-------------|

## 🧱 Purpose

The Vexos License Framework gives developers and organizations flexible licensing options for their projects — whether they’re:
- Fully open-source (like **Vexos Client Open**)  
- Closed and proprietary (like **Vexos Client Pro / Lite**)  
- Business or semi-open projects (licensed under **VBPL**)  

Each license is designed to be **simple, readable, and fair**, while respecting creators’ rights.

## 🗂️ License Files

All license texts are available in the [`/LICENSES`](./LICENSES) folder:
- [`OVL.txt`](./LICENSES/OVL.txt)
- [`VPL.txt`](./LICENSES/VPL.txt)
- [`VBPL.txt`](./LICENSES/VBPL.txt)

You may include these in your own repositories, with proper attribution to **Vexos**.

1. Copy the appropriate license file (`OVL.txt`, `VPL.txt`, or `VBPL.txt`) to your repository root.
